# ObjectToAnonymousExamples
.NET Core Console App containing examples of how to convert an object to an anonymous object

This repository contains 6 examples of converting an object to an anonymous object using 3 methods

1. A private static helper method that takes an object and an anonymous object as parameters
2. An extension method version of the first helper method
3. A set of instructions for how to use JsonConvert that casts the object to JSON and back to an Anonymous Type

Each method has two examples, one for an anonymous type with only primitives, one for an anonymous type with nested objects.
